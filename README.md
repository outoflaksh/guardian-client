# Guardian Plugin - Web Interface

## [View Prototype](https://guardian-web.vercel.app) - Project created for MUJ ACM Hacks 6.0 

### ❗The problem
Oftentimes, a student, or a person may be going somewhere, and they would find themselves to be in a secluded region where there is a threat of being attacked or robbed. 

Emergency systems currently take a lot time to track and reach the individual locations.


### ⚡The solution
Guardian is a third-party plugin for OS or messaging applications where the idea is that strangers help each other in threatening situations. 

Anytime a person feels a threat of being attacked, they can press a button and immediately an alert will be sent out to the officials, the person’s family, and everyone in a radius of 250 meters who has that app with the live location of the person.
